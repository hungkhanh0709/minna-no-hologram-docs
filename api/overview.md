# Overview of the API

> **Note:** This section is intended for developers who want to integrate with the Minna No Hologram platform or build custom tools.  
> End-users do not need to use the API to watch videos or read DIY articles.

The API for the Minna No Hologram platform is the backbone that connects the frontend web application, admin dashboard, and backend services. It enables seamless communication between user interfaces and core services such as content management, video processing, recommendations, and data storage.

## Purpose

The API provides a structured way for developers and operators to:
- Integrate with the platformâ€™s content (videos, articles, metadata)
- Automate content management and moderation tasks
- Retrieve analytics and user engagement data
- Enable third-party applications or services to interact with the platform

## Key Features

- **BFF (Backend For Frontend) API:**  
  Aggregates and delivers content to the frontend web application, combining data from processed video storage, CMS, cache, and the recommender API.
- **RESTful Design:**  
  Follows REST principles for consistency and ease of use.
- **Versioning:**  
  Ensures backward compatibility and smooth transitions between updates.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:**  
  Each endpoint is documented with details on methods, parameters, and expected responses.

## How It Fits Into the Project

The API is a crucial component of the Minna No Hologram ecosystem, enabling:
- Content delivery to end-users via the web application
- Content management and moderation via the admin dashboard
- Integration with backend services such as the CMS, video processing, and recommender systems
- Secure and scalable access to platform data

By providing a robust and well-documented interface, the API allows developers to build rich applications and tools that enhance the Minna No Hologram experience for both users and administrators.
